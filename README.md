# Zigma
- Zigma is an audio-based social network app built for college students. 
- We know it's easy to feel lonely and disconnected during quarantine, so we wanted to create a space where students can both connect with old friends and find new ones. 

Technologies used:
- Frontend: React Native, Bootstrap, 
- Backend: Agora API (WebRTC), NodeJS, Express, MongoDB.
